# Hospitalization Fcailities in New York City

In this study, I will try to create a picture of the existing Hospitalization facuilities in New York City related to the population distribution.

The study should pinpoint the locations where new Hospitals are needed at the present.

A more precice measure of healthcare availability is usually based on hospital beds per capita. But such data may not be available per hospital, so I will stick to hospital per capita, which can be a measure of the availability of, at least, emergency care.

## Steps of the study

 The study will start with the data collection from different online resources with special care for the reliability of the data sources, target data will be:
 
1- Population distribution

2- Number of Hospitals with their repective locations


## Then the relations will be created for:
 
1- Hospitals per capita for every Neighbourhood

2- The average distance to any hospital within the city

3- Identifying the Neighbourhoods least served by hospitals to recommend investing in new hospitals
